# Music Player using JavaScript
This is a simple and functional music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play audio files, interact with player buttons, and view song information.

# Features
- Play/Pause Functionality: Users can play and pause music.
- Song Information Display: Displays song details such as title, duration and cover image.
- Audio Controls: Includes play, pause, next, and previous buttons.
- Responsive Design: Adjusts layout based on screen size for a smooth user experience.

# Project Architecture
The project is structured into three main buckets:

# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
The HTML file defines the structure of the music player, including audio elements and buttons.

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
The CSS file adds styling to each HTML element, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design for the music player.

# JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity to the music player. It manages:

- Loading and playing music
- Handling player buttons (play, pause, next, previous)
- Displaying current music information

# How It Works
- HTML: Defines the structure of the player.
- CSS: Styles the player, giving it a clean, modern look.
- JavaScript: Handles the core functionality such as playing music, changing tracks, and updating the display with the current song information.
